|I hear the Snake Clan«0xe2»is coming to attack«0xe2»us!«0xe2»Gosh, I hope not!«*0»
|-
|0x12400e
|I hear they're allied«0xe2»with some kind of«0xe2»"desert demon"!«0xe2»How terrifying!«*0»
|-
|0x124010
|So the whole "desert«0xe2»demon" thing was just«0xe2»a rumor after all!«0xe2»I heard the truth from«0xe2»one of the Snake Clan«0xe2»Denjuu.«*0»
|-
|0x124012

|We're discussing how to«0xe2»keep the Bird Clan«0xe2»from using our Antenna«0xe2»Tree.«*0»
|-
|0x124028
|As if it's not enough for«0xe2»them to hoard all the«0xe2»water!«0xe2»They think the Antenna«0xe2»Tree should be theirs too!«*0»
