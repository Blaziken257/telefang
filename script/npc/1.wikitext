|There was a weird man«0xe2»heading to the north...«0xe2»I wonder what he«0xe2»wanted?«0xe2»Was it something to do«0xe2»with Netaro?«*0»
|-
|0x11c042
|Netaro's constant«0xe2»napping is a real«0xe2»problem...«*0»

|They call this place«0xe2»Kurinon Village.«*0»
|-
|0x11c046
|The village is kind of in«0xe2»a mess right now.«*0»
|-
|0x11c048
|The case was solved!«0xe2»What a relief.«*0»
|-
|0x11c04a
|Someone made off with«0xe2»the key we use for«0xe2»entering the Antenna«0xe2»Tree, man.«*0»
|-
|0x11c04c
|This sucks, man!«0xe2»Now we can't buy any«0xe2»fish from Iris...«*0»

|Kurinon is such a small«0xe2»village, we'd be in a«0xe2»lot of trouble if we lost«0xe2»the Antenna Tree...«*0»
|-
|0x11c052
|Honestly, who would want«0xe2»to keep people from«0xe2»using the Antenna Tree?«*0»
|-
|0x11c054
|So the culprits were a«0xe2»group called the«0xe2»"Kakuza Party"...«0xe2»I'd better call my«0xe2»Denjuu friends and let«0xe2»them know!«*0»
|-
|0x11c056
|The Denjuu in that house«0xe2»over there was in«0xe2»charge of the key to the«0xe2»Antenna Tree, man.«0xe2»There was a big«0xe2»commotion when he lost«0xe2»it...«*0»
|-

|-
|0x11c05a
|So the key really was«0xe2»stolen...«0xe2»I'm glad that's over, man.«*0»
|-
|0x11c05c
|I saw some unfamiliar«0xe2»Denjuu going into the«0xe2»cave by the coast, man.«0xe2»I wonder who it was?«0xe2»We're not supposed to go«0xe2»in there, man.«*0»
|-
|0x11c05e
|I guess that's why they«0xe2»don't want us going in«0xe2»there, man.«0xe2»It's so people can't do«0xe2»bad stuff like that, man.«*0»
|-
|0x11c060
|That human girl by the«0xe2»beach said she saw«0xe2»something, man.«0xe2»I wonder if it's true...«*0»
|-
|0x11c062
|Y'know, humans really«0xe2»are amazing, man...«0xe2»I wonder where they find«0xe2»so many of these«0xe2»awesome machines...«0xe2»Huh? You mean people«0xe2»don't dig machines out of«0xe2»the ground, man??«*0»

|Hey, hey, did something«0xe2»happen?«*0»

|-
|0x11c072
|Did you know that Denjuu«0xe2»are seperated into two«0xe2»main groups, man?«*0»
|-
|0x11c074
|There are two kinds of«0xe2»Denjuu, man: "Natural"«0xe2»and "Cultivated".«0xe2»Natural Denjuu can«0xe2»evolve by battling more,«0xe2»but Cultivated Denjuu«0xe2»can't evolve on their«0xe2»own, man.«0xe2»In order to evolve, they«0xe2»need their DNA spliced«0xe2»with another Denjuu in a«0xe2»laboratory, man.«*0»
|-
|0x11c076
|You can get DNA by«0xe2»using a Phone Card on«0xe2»a Denjuu, man.«0xe2»Once you have some«0xe2»DNA, head to the left«0xe2»counter inside a shop,«0xe2»man!«*0»

|It is pretty scary when«0xe2»they get angry like«0xe2»this, though...«*0»
