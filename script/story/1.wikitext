|-

|Most likely...«0xe2»It's because of that«0xe2»D-Shot we found...«0xe2»Look at the D-Shot's«0xe2»screen for a second.«0xe2»It shows four bars of«0xe2»reception, right?«0xe2»Normal cell phones can«0xe2»only have up to three«0xe2»bars, but this phone«0xe2»can even catch the«0xe2»signals from the Denjuu«0xe2»World!«0xe2»A cell phone with four«0xe2»bars of reception!«0xe2»That's what a D-Shot«0xe2»is!!«*0»
|-

|It lets you send calls«0xe2»to the Denjuu World,«0xe2»and even allows humans«0xe2»to travel there!«0xe2»It's truly an amazing«0xe2»piece of technology!«0xe2»But it's strange...«0xe2»Normally, D-Shots are«0xe2»really difficult to get«0xe2»ahold of.«0xe2»So why would someone«0xe2»just leave one there...«0xe2»Hmmm, it's a mystery!«0xe2»Now then, where are«0xe2»we?«0xe2»Let's start looking«0xe2»around!«*0»

|«&0xc92c», let's go«0xe2»with him.«0xe2»This Denjuu doesn't look«0xe2»like a bad person.«0xe2»If we follow him, we«0xe2»might learn something.«*0»
|-
|0x120116
|Hohoho.«0xe2»There is nothing to be«0xe2»afraid of.«0xe2»I am not going to eat«0xe2»you, or any such thing.«0xe2»Now then, are you«0xe2»familiar with the Denjuu«0xe2»World?«0xe2»«0»Yes   «0»No«*a»
|-
|0x120118
|Ah, then I suppose I«0xe2»should explain.«*0»
|-
|0x12011a
|The Human World and the«0xe2»Denjuu World...«0xe2»The two worlds have«0xe2»always been seperated«0xe2»by a "curtain of«0xe2»darkness", but human«0xe2»scientists have«0xe2»discovered a way to«0xe2»pass through it.«*0»
|-
|0x12011c
|The Denjuu World is a«0xe2»harsh place to live,«0xe2»however...«0xe2»Which is why the«0xe2»humans began to befriend«0xe2»us Denjuu.«*0»
|-
|0x12011e
|As a sign of the«0xe2»friendship between us,«0xe2»the humans gave us the«0xe2»"D-Shot" mobile phones«0xe2»so that we could always«0xe2»contact each other.«*0»
|-
|0x120120
|That is the type of«0xe2»phone you found«0xe2»underneath the tree.«*0»
|-
|0x120122
|Phones that allow one to«0xe2»contact friends at any«0xe2»time are a great«0xe2»convenience to us, as«0xe2»well.«0xe2»Because of this, it has«0xe2»become customary to«0xe2»exchange phone numbers«0xe2»with any friends that we«0xe2»meet.«*0»
|-
|0x120124
|However, among us Denjuu«0xe2»there are many who«0xe2»believe that strength is«0xe2»key, and refuse to see«0xe2»those weaker than them«0xe2»as their friends.«0xe2»In these cases, one must«0xe2»battle if they truly«0xe2»wish to befriend the«0xe2»other.«0xe2»These fights between«0xe2»Denjuu are known as«0xe2»"Telefang".«*0»
|-
|0x120126
|So?«0xe2»Do you understand«0xe2»now?«0xe2»«0»Yes   «0»No«*a»
|-
|0x120128
|Then we shall discuss«0xe2»the reason you were«0xe2»called here.«*0»
|-
|0x12012a
|A Denjuu named Netaro«0xe2»lives at this village's«0xe2»water source.«0xe2»He is always dozing«0xe2»off. Such a troublesome«0xe2»fellow....«0xe2»Netaro has the«0xe2»important job of«0xe2»carrying water for the«0xe2»village, but for the«0xe2»last few days we have«0xe2»been unable to contact«0xe2»him.«0xe2»If he stops bringing«0xe2»the water, it will«0xe2»trouble the villagers.«0xe2»That is why we want you«0xe2»to look for him.«*0»
|-
|0x12012c
|There is just one«0xe2»problem, and that is«0xe2»Netaro's younger brother,«0xe2»Nejiro.«0xe2»He is another«0xe2»troublemaker...«0xe2»He seems to have«0xe2»misunderstood the«0xe2»situation, and may try«0xe2»to hurt you.«*0»
|-
|0x12012e
|For that reason, I am«0xe2»having you take this«0xe2»Denjuu along with you.«0xe2»Think of him as your«0xe2»first friend in the«0xe2»Denjuu World.«*0»
|-
|0x120130
|Hello, my name is«0xe2»Fungus.«0xe2»Here is my phone number.«0xe2»It's nice to meet you!«*0»

|-
|0x120174
|I let Netaro sleep in«0xe2»the innermost room so«0xe2»that the Kakuza Party«0xe2»couldn't reach him.«0xe2»I hid the key to the«0xe2»room in a box...«0xe2»But I think it's okay for«0xe2»you to have it.«0xe2»Go in there and wake him«0xe2»up!«0xe2»As a favor for me, too!«*0»
|-

|-
|0x12019a
|Ah!! I was beaten!«0xe2»At times like this...«0xe2»It's best to run away!«*0»
|-
|0x12019c
|What!? «0xe2»Tabasco lost? «0xe2»This is unbelievable! «0xe2»And I don't know how«0xe2»to use a D-Shot...«0xe2»Fine! I'll overlook«0xe2»what happened today!«0xe2»But take heed, next«0xe2»time I won't be so easy«0xe2»on you!«0xe2»Well then, for the bright«0xe2»future...!!«*0»

|-
|0x1201b8
|I sealed this gate«0xe2»because of the strange«0xe2»events happening lately,«0xe2»but it shouldn't be a«0xe2»problem for you now.«*0»
|-
|0x1201ba

|-
|0x1201d6
|...Well in that case, I'll«0xe2»just have to make sure«0xe2»YOU don't talk, man.«0xe2»Since you're the only«0xe2»one who knows...«0xe2»Prepare yourself!!«0xe2»Let's Telefang, man!«*0»

|-
|0x1201e6
|He went off somewhere«0xe2»after we battled.«0xe2»Actually, I'm looking for«0xe2»the culprit who stole«0xe2»the the key to the«0xe2»Antenna Tree right now.«*0»
|-
|0x1201e8
|Wait, you weren't«0xe2»seriously suspecting«0xe2»Suguri, were you?«0xe2»He's one of my friends,«0xe2»he'd never do something«0xe2»like that.«*0»
|-
