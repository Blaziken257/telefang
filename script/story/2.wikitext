|-
|0x12c0fe
|Listen to this!«0xe2»Just up ahead of here«0xe2»there's a town called«0xe2»Barran...«0xe2»The bird and snake«0xe2»Denjuu there have been«0xe2»at each other's throats«0xe2»for generations.«0xe2»Would YOU wanna live«0xe2»somewhere like that?«0xe2»I'm sick of watching«0xe2»them fight every day,«0xe2»so I'm leaving town.«*0»
|-
|0x12c100
|I see... «0xe2»Why have they been«0xe2»fighting for so long?«*0»
|-
|0x12c102
|If you want to know, you«0xe2»should talk to the«0xe2»chief of the Bird Clan.«0xe2»I'm off to start a new«0xe2»life in Freesia.«0xe2»It'll be nice to live«0xe2»somewhere peaceful for a«0xe2»change...«0xe2»Tell that to the chief«0xe2»when you see him, too.«*0»
|-
|0x12c104
|...Hey, if you're in the«0xe2»area, feel free to drop«0xe2»by.«0xe2»My name is "Ganbanno".«0xe2»Seeya!«*0»
|-
|0x12c106
|................«0xe2»I guess I should at«0xe2»least go talk to the«0xe2»chief...«0xe2»He wanted me to pass a«0xe2»message along anyway...«0xe2»Alright! Let's head for«0xe2»Barran!«*0»
|-
|0x12c108
|Welcome to the town of«0xe2»Barran, human visitor!«0xe2»I am the chief of the«0xe2»Bird Clan.«*0»
|-
|0x12c10a
|I met a Denjuu named«0xe2»"Ganbanno" on the way«0xe2»here...«0xe2»He said he doesn't«0xe2»want to live somewhere«0xe2»where they fight every«0xe2»day, so he's going to«0xe2»start a new life in«0xe2»Freesia.«*0»
|-
|0x12c10c
|Ganbanno? «0xe2»Darn it, telling the«0xe2»humans all about our«0xe2»problems...«0xe2»But I do see where he's«0xe2»coming from.«0xe2»Indeed, the Bird and«0xe2»Snake Clans have been«0xe2»at odds with each other«0xe2»for a very long time«0xe2»now.«*0»
|-
|0x12c10e
|Why have you guys been«0xe2»fighting for so long?«*0»
|-
|0x12c110
|We've forgotten how it«0xe2»started, but it was«0xe2»probably over some«0xe2»trivial thing.«0xe2»Then the argument just«0xe2»got bigger and bigger«0xe2»over time...«0xe2»To be honest, I'm«0xe2»growing tired of the«0xe2»whole ordeal.«*0»
|-
|0x12c112
|In that case, why don't«0xe2»you put aside your«0xe2»differences and call a«0xe2»truce?«*0»
|-
|0x12c114
|It's no use, they won't«0xe2»speak to anyone from«0xe2»the Bird Clan.«0xe2»It always turns into«0xe2»another fight...«*0»
|-
|0x12c116
|I've got it!«0xe2»If we let a human like«0xe2»you deliver the message,«0xe2»they may be willing to«0xe2»listen!«0xe2»Do you think you could«0xe2»do it?«*0»
|-
|0x12c118
|................«0xe2»Well, it'd be way more«0xe2»fun here if everyone«0xe2»could get along...«0xe2»Alright! I'll honor your«0xe2»request!«*0»
|-

|Whaat?! A messenger«0xe2»from the Bird Clan?«0xe2»Then you're one of them!«0xe2»If that's the case, I«0xe2»can't just allow you to«0xe2»leave...«0xe2»Telefang with me!«*0»
|-
|0x12c124

|-
|0x12c126
|I just told you!«0xe2»I was sent here to«0xe2»bring a message of peace«0xe2»from the Bird Clan!«*0»

|Well then, that settles«0xe2»it!«*0»
|-
|0x12c12c
|Wait! Hold on...«0xe2»We can't put our«0xe2»differences aside that«0xe2»easily.«0xe2»We have our pride, after«0xe2»all.«0xe2»Hmm, yes...«*0»

|I've got it!«0xe2»Lately I've been«0xe2»wanting to own a "Plush«0xe2»Toy".«0xe2»How about you bring one«0xe2»to me?«0xe2»The chief of the Bird«0xe2»Clan should have one.«*0»
|-
|0x12c130
|So if I bring you a«0xe2»"Plush Toy", you'll make«0xe2»peace with the Bird«0xe2»Clan?«0xe2»Alright!«0xe2»I'll go talk to the«0xe2»Bird Chief and bring it«0xe2»back here!«*0»
|-
|0x12c132
|Go ask the chief of the«0xe2»Bird Clan for his«0xe2»"Plush toy" and bring it«0xe2»back to me.«0xe2»If you do, I will agree«0xe2»to stop the fighting!«*0»
|-
