|I can't take it anymore!!«*0»
|-
|0x12c0fc
|Hey, what happened?«*0»
|-
|0x12c0fe
|Listen to this!«0xe2»Just up ahead of here«0xe2»there's a town called«0xe2»Barran...«0xe2»The bird and snake«0xe2»Denjuu there have been«0xe2»at each other's throats«0xe2»for generations.«0xe2»Would YOU wanna live«0xe2»somewhere like that?«0xe2»I'm sick of watching«0xe2»them fight every day,«0xe2»so I'm leaving town.«*0»
|-
|0x12c100
|I see... «0xe2»Why have they been«0xe2»fighting for so long?«*0»
|-
|0x12c102
|If you want to know, you«0xe2»should talk to the«0xe2»chief of the Bird Clan.«0xe2»I'm off to start a new«0xe2»life in Freesia.«0xe2»It'll be nice to live«0xe2»somewhere peaceful for a«0xe2»change...«0xe2»Tell that to the chief«0xe2»when you see him, too.«*0»
|-
|0x12c104
|...Hey, if you're in the«0xe2»area, feel free to drop«0xe2»by.«0xe2»My name is "Ganbanno".«0xe2»Seeya!«*0»
|-
|0x12c106
|................«0xe2»I guess I should at«0xe2»least go talk to the«0xe2»chief...«0xe2»He wanted me to pass a«0xe2»message along anyway...«0xe2»Alright! Let's head for«0xe2»Barran!«*0»
|-
|0x12c108
|Welcome to the town of«0xe2»Barran, human visitor!«0xe2»I am the chief of the«0xe2»Bird Clan.«*0»
|-
|0x12c10a
|I met a Denjuu named«0xe2»"Ganbanno" on the way«0xe2»here...«0xe2»He said he doesn't«0xe2»want to live somewhere«0xe2»where they fight every«0xe2»day, so he's going to«0xe2»start a new life in«0xe2»Freesia.«*0»
|-
|0x12c10c
|Ganbanno? «0xe2»Darn it, telling the«0xe2»humans all about our«0xe2»problems...«0xe2»But I do see where he's«0xe2»coming from.«0xe2»Indeed, the Bird and«0xe2»Snake Clans have been«0xe2»at odds with each other«0xe2»for a very long time«0xe2»now.«*0»
|-
|0x12c10e
|Why have you guys been«0xe2»fighting for so long?«*0»
|-
|0x12c110
|We've forgotten how it«0xe2»started, but it was«0xe2»probably over some«0xe2»trivial thing.«0xe2»Then the argument just«0xe2»got bigger and bigger«0xe2»over time...«0xe2»To be honest, I'm«0xe2»growing tired of the«0xe2»whole ordeal.«*0»
|-
|0x12c112
|In that case, why don't«0xe2»you put aside your«0xe2»differences and call a«0xe2»truce?«*0»
|-
|0x12c114
|It's no use, they won't«0xe2»speak to anyone from«0xe2»the Bird Clan.«0xe2»It always turns into«0xe2»another fight...«*0»
|-
|0x12c116
|I've got it!«0xe2»If we let a human like«0xe2»you deliver the message,«0xe2»they may be willing to«0xe2»listen!«0xe2»Do you think you could«0xe2»do it?«*0»
|-
|0x12c118
|................«0xe2»Well, it'd be way more«0xe2»fun here if everyone«0xe2»could get along...«0xe2»Alright! I'll honor your«0xe2»request!«*0»
|-
|0x12c11a
|Oho! Thank you!«0xe2»I'll be sure to reward«0xe2»you when you come back.«0xe2»We're counting on you!«*0»

|Whaat?! A messenger«0xe2»from the Bird Clan?«0xe2»Then you're one of them!«0xe2»If that's the case, I«0xe2»can't just allow you to«0xe2»leave...«0xe2»Telefang with me!«*0»
|-
|0x12c124

|-
|0x12c126
|I just told you!«0xe2»I was sent here to«0xe2»bring a message of peace«0xe2»from the Bird Clan!«*0»
|-
|0x12c128
|!!«0xe2»The Bird Clan wants to«0xe2»make peace with us?«0xe2»Actually, I had been«0xe2»thinking the exact same«0xe2»thing...«*0»
|-
|0x12c12a
|Well then, that settles«0xe2»it!«*0»
|-
|0x12c12c
|Wait! Hold on...«0xe2»We can't put our«0xe2»differences aside that«0xe2»easily.«0xe2»We have our pride, after«0xe2»all.«0xe2»Hmm, yes...«*0»
|-
|0x12c12e
|I've got it!«0xe2»Lately I've been«0xe2»wanting to own a "Plush«0xe2»Toy".«0xe2»How about you bring one«0xe2»to me?«0xe2»The chief of the Bird«0xe2»Clan should have one.«*0»
|-
|0x12c130
|So if I bring you a«0xe2»"Plush Toy", you'll make«0xe2»peace with the Bird«0xe2»Clan?«0xe2»Alright!«0xe2»I'll go talk to the«0xe2»Bird Chief and bring it«0xe2»back here!«*0»
|-
|0x12c132
|Go ask the chief of the«0xe2»Bird Clan for his«0xe2»"Plush toy" and bring it«0xe2»back to me.«0xe2»If you do, I will agree«0xe2»to stop the fighting!«*0»
|-
|0x12c134
|How did it go?«0xe2»....A "Plush Toy", eh?«0xe2»Alright then, hmmm...«0xe2»Where did I leave it?«*0»
|-
|0x12c136
|Oh no! That's right!«0xe2»That Ganbanno must«0xe2»have taken it with him«0xe2»when he left!«*0»
|-
|0x12c138
|You said he went to«0xe2»Freesia, right?«0xe2»Sorry to ask you this,«0xe2»but could you find him«0xe2»and ask for it back?«0xe2»Thank you! Good luck!«*0»
|-
|0x12c13a
|Please, find Ganbanno in«0xe2»Freesia and bring back«0xe2»the "Plush Toy"!«*0»

|!!«0xe2»Even when things were«0xe2»so bad before..?«0xe2»What do you mean they«0xe2»"might" though?«0xe2»Is there a problem?«*0»

|-
|0x12c14a
|...I mean, I would really«0xe2»like that to happen,«0xe2»but...«0xe2»................«0xe2»I can't just give it«0xe2»away!«0xe2»That leaves only one«0xe2»option...«0xe2»Telefang me!«*0»
|-

|Yowch... You're pretty«0xe2»strong!«0xe2»Alright, as promised,«0xe2»here you go!«*0»
|-
|0x12c14e
|Got the "Plush Toy"!«*0»
|-
|0x12c150
|Oh! I guess this means«0xe2»there's no reason for«0xe2»me to leave Barran«0xe2»now...«0xe2»What should I do?«0xe2»Think I should go back?«*0»
|-
|0x12c152
|You should!«0xe2»I'm sure they'd be«0xe2»happy to see you!«*0»
|-

|Go on! I'll head back to«0xe2»town later.«*0»
|-
|0x12c158
|Oho, well done!«0xe2»I see you managed to«0xe2»find the "Plush Toy"!«0xe2»With this the Snake«0xe2»Chief should agree to«0xe2»make amends!«*0»

|Wait!«0xe2»First I must reward«0xe2»you for all you have«0xe2»done.«0xe2»Here, please take this.«*0»

|Gave away the "Plush«0xe2»Toy".«*0»
|-
|0x12c16c
|Yes, here it is! A "Plush«0xe2»Toy"! «0xe2»Then, as promised, I will«0xe2»call a truce between«0xe2»us and the Bird Clan!«0xe2»As proof, I'll give the«0xe2»order to unlock the«0xe2»Antenna Tree gates«0xe2»immediately.«0xe2»That should settle«0xe2»everything!«*0»
|-
|0x12c16e
|Hello, «&0xc92c»?«0xe2»It's me, Matsukiyo...«0xe2»Can you tell me where«0xe2»you are right now?«*0»
|-
|0x12c170
|Hmmm...«0xe2»Not really sure, but«0xe2»it's definitely a lot«0xe2»greener here.«*0»
|-
|0x12c172
|It sounds like you've«0xe2»arrived on "Ion«0xe2»Island".«0xe2»From what I've heard,«0xe2»there's some kind of«0xe2»disagreement happening«0xe2»between the phone«0xe2»companies there.«0xe2»I don't know the details,«0xe2»but you might be able«0xe2»to ask the Denjuu living«0xe2»there for more«0xe2»information.«*0»

|Help meee!«*0»
|-
|0x12c176
|Whoa! What's going on?«*0»

|Right now, the phone«0xe2»companies on this«0xe2»island are trying to jam«0xe2»each other's signals!«0xe2»The Denjuu here have«0xe2»gotten involved, and«0xe2»now it's turning into a«0xe2»huge mess!«0xe2»It's horrible...«0xe2»This island used to be«0xe2»such a peaceful place...«*0»
|-
|0x12c17a
|Is there no way to get«0xe2»them to stop?«*0»
|-
|0x12c17c
|Well... If we could«0xe2»somehow cut off their«0xe2»phone signals, I'm sure a«0xe2»lot of them would leave«0xe2»the island...«0xe2»But's that's not really«0xe2»possible, especially for«0xe2»me...«*0»
|-
|0x12c17e
|Hey, there's no point«0xe2»giving up already!«0xe2»I'm sure if we work«0xe2»together, we can figure«0xe2»something out!«*0»

|Block signals...?«0xe2»Well, there's one Denjuu«0xe2»I know named "Noisy"...«0xe2»Why do you ask?«*0»
|-
|0x12c19e
|Seriously?!«0xe2»I'm trying to stop the«0xe2»fight over the phone«0xe2»signals here.«0xe2»Do you think you could«0xe2»contact him?«*0»
|-

|Finally!«0xe2»You're that guy, right?«0xe2»Noisy?«*0»
|-
|0x12c1aa
|Huh. Are you always this«0xe2»rude when you meet«0xe2»someone new?«0xe2»I suppose you're the«0xe2»one Miyo was talking«0xe2»about?«*0»

|Yup! Actually, I have a«0xe2»favor to ask you.«*0»
|-
|0x12c1ae
|Still with the attitude,«0xe2»huh?«0xe2»Hmph! Miyo sure sent me«0xe2»an annoying guy to«0xe2»deal with...«0xe2»So? What do you want?«*0»
|-
|0x12c1b0
|I need you to come with«0xe2»me to Ion Island.«0xe2»With your ability, we«0xe2»should be able to stop«0xe2»the fighting that's going«0xe2»on over there.«0xe2»So, will you help?«*0»

|-
|0x12c1d0
|Okay!«0xe2»That should make it so«0xe2»no signals can reach the«0xe2»island!«*0»
|-

|The Master? What kind«0xe2»of Denjuu is he?«*0»
|-

|I've never met him«0xe2»myself, but I've heard«0xe2»stories from the Denjuu«0xe2»training here.«0xe2»I'm sure if you ask the«0xe2»Denjuu training in the«0xe2»forest, you might be able«0xe2»to find out where he is!«*0»
|-
|0x12c1e4
|Alright!«0xe2»In that case, I'll head«0xe2»into the forest and try«0xe2»asking them about the«0xe2»Master!«0xe2»I wonder what kind of«0xe2»Denjuu he is?«0xe2»I can't wait!«*0»
