# Tools for Google Sheets

Google Apps Script tools used to make the translation sheet more pleasant and fun. Use [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp) to get them from or push them to the sheet: anytime after having logged in using `clasp login`, run `clasp pull` to fetch the tools from the server for version control and such, and `clasp push` to put the ones in this folder into use. Provided you have edit access to the sheet, that is, of course!
