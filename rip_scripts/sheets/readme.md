# Tools for Google Sheets

Google Apps Script tools used to make the translation sheet more pleasant and fun. Use [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp) to push these to the sheet â€“ anytime after having logged in using `clasp login`, run `clasp push` to put them into use. Provided you have edit access to the sheet, that is, of course!
