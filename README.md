A partial disassembly of Telefang Power Version.

To build, the following ROMs of Telefang Power and Speed are required:

```
$ md5sum baserom_pw.gbc baserom_sp.gbc
8b0a1b6667040a52f6957c0eeea1dbd7  baserom_pw.gbc
ebfe05828463cc004898e6a95ee57fea  baserom_sp.gbc
```

This disassembly uses the `overlay` feature of RGBDS currently only
present in Sanqui's fork: https://github.com/Sanqui/rgbds
