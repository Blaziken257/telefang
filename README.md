A partial disassembly of Telefang Power Version with English translation patch
changes on top, building on top of the last non-version-controlled patch
version, v108.  The IPS patch for this version is included in this repo
and should produce the correct baserom_patch.gbc when patched on top
of a Japanese Telefang Power ROM (md5sum` 8b0a1b6667040a52f6957c0eeea1dbd7`).

baserom_patch.gbc should have md5sum `1aaaca6108aae2e85d5fac18eabbe221`.

This disassembly uses the `overlay` feature of RGBDS currently only
present in Sanqui's fork: https://github.com/Sanqui/rgbds
